      <p>
        Hello! I'm Vishal, a commerce graduate turned aspiring full-stack web developer. After completing my Master of Commerce, I worked as an SDS Associate at Amazon, where I honed my analytical and operational skills in a fast-paced environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        My curiosity for technology led me to explore web development, and I’ve been hooked ever since. I enrolled in Angela Yu’s Complete Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy, where I’ve learned everything from HTML and CSS to Node.js, Express, and React.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy building clean, functional web applications and solving real-world problems through code. My goal is to join a dynamic tech team where I can continue learning, contribute meaningfully, and grow as a developer.
